# Deep Reinforcement Learning Based Games

This repository contains a collection of games that use deep reinforcement learning algorithms to train intelligent agents to play the games.

## Contents

- `game1/`: Contains the code and resources for Game 1.
- `game2/`: Contains the code and resources for Game 2.
- `game3/`: Contains the code and resources for Game 3.

## Dependencies

To run the code in this repository, you will need to install the following dependencies:

- [Python 3.6+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/install)
- [OpenAI Gym](https://gym.openai.com/docs/)

## Usage

To train an agent to play Game 1, navigate to the `game1/` directory and run the following command:
```
python train.py
```

To evaluate the trained agent, run:
```
python evaluate.py
```
You can repeat the above steps for the other games in the `game2/` and `game3/` directories.

## Contributions

We welcome contributions to this repository! If you have an idea for a new game or want to improve the existing ones, please feel free to create a pull request.
